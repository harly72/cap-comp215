        "This example provides a basic demonstration of how to animate a 2D model using `Animation2D`. The `ToggleGrid` model is intentionally simplistic to focus on the mechanics of setting up and running an animation. In your actual implementation with the `ForestFire` model or any other complex model, you would replace the `ToggleGrid` model with your model instance and ensure that the `step` and `draw` methods are defined to reflect your model's dynamics.\n",
        "\n",

I'll provide a simplified example that includes the necessary elements. This example assumes that both the `ForestFire` model and the `Animation2D` class are defined correctly, as they are essential components for the animation.\n",

        "- `draw(axes, step)`: Draws the current state of the model onto the provided `matplotlib` axes. The `step` parameter can be used to display the current time step or any other relevant information as the title.\n",

        "```python\n",
        "animation.show()\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Full Example Code\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Assuming ForestFire and Animation2D classes are defined above\n",
        "\n",

        "This model is similiar to diffusion and percolation in the sense of spread and fluctuation. <br>\n",
        "Regarding the quality of spread, models spread information in similar ways. This model grows forested areas and fire propigates outwards from some critical point wich is very similar to how percolation models would also transmit information. Generally diffustion model do not exhibit this feat however similar results can still be obtained through selective filters. <br>\n",
        "Regarding the quality of fluctuation, models have the ability to flucuate states. When it come to this model it has generally two states (a thrid being empty) a growth state and a purge state. In the growth state nothing is on fire and forest squres prosper. In the purge state, a fire square is gerneated and the surrounding forest in reverted to an empty square propigating from its origin. Diffusion models are similar as data can go through a transfermation (may be gradual) via a filter. The new data would differ from the old and this can be said to be period."
